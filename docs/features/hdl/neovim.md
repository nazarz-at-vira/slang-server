# Hardware Language Features - Neovim

The Neovim [slang-server.nvim](https://github.com/hudson-trading/slang-server.nvim) plugin should be installed to use all features on this page. Once installed the `SlangServer` command will provide a number of subcommands outlined below.

## Setting a Compilation

### Setting a build file

```
:SlangServer setBuildFile BUILDFILE
```

This uses the file located at `BUILDFILE` to compile a full hierarchy and is required for some of the commands below.

### Setting a top level

```
:SlangServer setTopLevel [TOPFILE]
```

This uses a file to run a compilation using the top-most module in the provided file.  If `TOPFILE` is not provided the file from the current buffer will be used.

## HierarchyView

```
:SlangServer hierarchy [SCOPE]
```

This opens the hierarchy view and, if `SCOPE` is provided, expands the view to that scope. Without `SCOPE`, it reveals the known active path when available.

![Hierarchy View](neovim/hierarchy.png)

The hierarchy opens with a Cells view that groups elaborated instances by module. Press `<Space>` on a module to list its instances, then `<CR>` on an instance to make it active, jump to its source, and reveal it in the hierarchy. Pressing `<CR>` on an instance in the hierarchy also makes it active; `gd` opens its declaration without changing the selection. Press `/` in either view to search the hierarchy. Press `?` for help, or see the [default mappings](https://github.com/hudson-trading/slang-server/blob/main/clients/neovim/lua/slang-server/_core/config.lua).

If Neovim code-lens display is enabled, module and interface declarations show the active path and instance count. Activating that code lens opens `vim.ui.select` when multiple instances are available. Generate-loop code lenses similarly select an active elaborated iteration.

The active instance supplies the context for resolved parameter values, dependent types and widths, interface connections, hovers, and parameter-value inlay hints. An open hierarchy follows active-instance changes initiated by a code lens or Go to Definition.

### Search hierarchy

```
:SlangServer searchHierarchy
```

This opens an interactive search over the compiled design and reveals the selected object in the hierarchy. FzfLua, Telescope, and Snacks Picker are supported when installed, with a two-step `vim.ui.input` and `vim.ui.select` fallback.

Search includes instances, generate scopes, signals, parameters, and interface port members, even in unexpanded parts of the tree. Enter a name or hierarchical path fragment. Matching is case-insensitive, supports fuzzy path matches, and returns up to 100 results; refine the query to narrow a larger result set.

### Select active instance

```
:SlangServer selectActive
```

This runs an active-instance or active-generate-iteration code lens on the current source line. Code lenses must be enabled as described in the [installation guide](/start/installing.md#code-lenses).

## Cone Tracing (experimental)

```
:lua vim.lsp.buf.incoming_calls()
```

With a build file or top level selected, place the cursor on a signal and run this command to trace its drivers through the [incoming call hierarchy](https://neovim.io/doc/user/lsp.html#vim.lsp.buf.incoming_calls()). If the signal has multiple instances, choose an instance first, then select a driver to navigate to its source.


## Waveform Integration (experimental)

![WCP](neovim/wcp.gif)

`slang-server` can interact with waveform viewers via the [WCP (waveform control protocol)](https://gitlab.com/waveform-control-protocol/wcp).
The only known implementation of WCP is currently in [Surfer](https://surfer-project.org/).

### Editor Features

#### Open Waveform File

```
:SlangServer openWaveform WAVEFILE
```

This opens the waveform file (e.g. VCD or FST) indicated by `WAVEFILE`.
If there is no currently active WCP session a new waveform viewer will be launched using the command provided in the `wcpCommand` config field.
By default this is Surfer.
If a WCP session already exists, the new waveform file will be loaded.
Additionally, if a `buildPattern` config field is provided, the build file which corresponds to the current wave file will be used to produce a compilation.
E.g. given a wave file of `/some/dir/foo.fst` and a `buildPattern` of `/some/other/dir/{}.f`, a compilation will be made using `/some/other/dir/foo.f`.


#### Add Item

```
:SlangServer addToWaves [RECURSIVE]
```

Adds the signal, module, interface or other scope currently under the cursor to the waveform viewer.
If `RECURSIVE` is provided and is `true` and the item is a scope it will be added recursively.
If more than one instance of the item exists, a list of instances will be provided to choose from.
