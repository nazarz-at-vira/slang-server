# Change Log

All major and minor changes to this project will be documented in this file.

Clients require a server with the same or greater major and minor version in order to get the full feature set.
Patches published for either are independent.
For patch releases applied to the server or one of the various clients, please look at the git log, as they are only documented here as part of following minor release.

Vscode versions are specified in `clients/vscode/package.json`.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

<!-- new-release-here -->

## v0.3.0 Major Changes

- Active instances in VS Code and Neovim: select module/interface instances and generate-loop iterations through CodeLens or hierarchy views. Hovers and parameter-value inlays use the selected instance's values, types, and connections.
- Search the elaborated hierarchy by name or path, including signals and interface ports. Neovim supports FzfLua, Telescope, Snacks Picker, and a `vim.ui` fallback.
- Interface ports and their members are visible in the hierarchy, alongside resolved type parameters.
- Struct assignment patterns have field hovers and navigation, whole-struct and field completions, and inferred-type inlay hints.
- Completions include nested struct paths, global typedefs and classes, and more results for incomplete types and interface and instance arrays.
- Hovers show driver source snippets, macro-generated driver context, linked type declarations, and resolved interface type parameters. Hovers and navigation support multiple symbols, including both sides of implicit port connections.
- Shallow analysis infers interface port value and type parameters from `$static_assert` equality constraints.
- Driver/load tracing commands return hierarchical paths with source locations. Incoming call hierarchy supports drivers; outgoing call hierarchy no longer supports loads.
- Expanded document outlines and improved ranges for sticky scroll.
- Saving a dependency refreshes diagnostics in dependent open files. Single-unit builds preserve full-design diagnostics when build files are opened; per-file macro inheritance remains limited.
- Nix development shell with build and test dependencies.
- Client/server major and minor version compatibility warnings and coordinated minor releases.

This summary includes features added in the preceding 0.2.x patch releases. See the [git history](https://github.com/hudson-trading/slang-server/compare/v0.2.2...v0.3.0) for the full changes since the previous entry.
